# Project Setup

## Software Requirements
1. Node JS v18+

## Backend
1. Go inside backend folder through terminal or cmd
2. Run `npm install`
3. After successful downloads of all packages run this command in terminal `npm start`


## Frontend
1. Go inside frontend folder through terminal or cmd
2. Run `npm install`
3. After successful downloads of all packages run this command in terminal `npm run dev`
4. Then navigate to following link: `http://localhost:3000/`


## Note
1. Make sure both backend and frontend are running.
2. To save time environment values are directly used in development files instead of creating .env file, which is not a good practice.
